            <h2>My experience of mindfulness conversation</h2>
            <p>When given the opportunity to be heard we realise we have more to say, and when i say things out loud even i acknowledge them more. The feeling of being totally listened to it’s really rewarding. I discovered when i was engaged in a mindfulness conversation i feel I can pause and contemplate thoughts and communication, there was time to pause without getting distracted or inturupted.<br><br>Quite often it’s very different to find the opportunity in everyday life to do that, life is so busy sometimes you feel you have to rush through everything. Our thoughts and verbal communication often feel rushed, and as a result we can be left feeling that are breakdowns of communication. Doing this small technique with George reminded me very clearly that giving time to each other to purely listen with 100% attention can only have a positive outcome, it has some really powerful outcomes. Time really is the most valuable thing we can give one another.</p>

              <h3>Walking meditation</h3>

              <p>Walking meditation is one of the Suggested techniques i will use to sustain my practice - There is opportunity to do this everyday, which means regualr small practise can train out brain, even in the simplest form of daily activity!</p><br/>
              <h3>Listening and looping back.</h3>
              <p>Applying mindfullness to others is definitely something i will work more on. Being mindful of valuing others that you love (and anyone you know and respect)  and that they deserve our attention. We all know this, but to be  ‘mindfull’ adds so much more, and everybody gets more from the communication. The aspect of looping is also a great way for clarity - making sure, me as the listener has fully understood what the person has cummunicated with me, by reiterating what i think the person has said, and making sure i am accurate by talking it through again. Not much chance for crossed wires or guess work if we practise this! I feel i am already aware of some of this, and to a certain degree already practise this, but will try and practise this more in everyday life to a higher degree.</p>
