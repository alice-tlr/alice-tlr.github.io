            <h2>Emotional response</h2>
            <p>
              This week chapter 5 of Search inside yourself talks about emotional response, and how to develop the skills of <em>“From Compulsion to Choice”.</em> It's been an insightful read, and i have already put some practise into mastering some of these skills, which has already been beneficial. <br><br> The first question i was asked to write about was <strong>"When programming, what are some of your triggers? What causes a disproportionate emotional response?"</strong> Three things that sprung to mind where:
              <ul>
                <li>Feeling over whelmed with too much new information at once.</li>
                <li>Not being clear of my objective.</li>
                <li>Not knowing where to start.</li>
              </ul>
            </p>

              <h3>Siberian North Railroad exercise</h3>

              <p>The practice called the Siberian North Railroad was designed for dealing with emotional triggers that causes disproportional emotional responses. with the 5 key factors being:
                <ul>
                  <li>Stop - <em>Pausing if even for a moment gives you the chance to choose how you response to a situation.</em></li>
                  <li>Breath - <em>By focusing on slowing down our breath we create more time for contemplation of response.</em></li>
                  <li>Notice - <em>Our body is responsing physically, take note that this is a physical reaction as much as anything, and we have control over that.</em></li>
                  <li>Reflect - <em>Can you understand why you responded in such a way, are there historical patterens with this behaviour, and if so why?</em></li>
                  <li>Respond - <em>Try and establish a why of coming through this situation with a positive outcome.</em></li>
                </ul>
              </p>
              <br />


              <p>
                I found this exercise a great way of preventing a stressful situation becoming so over whelming that i get cross and then become unproductive and ultimately i would of lost time by mentally shutting off for a period of time.
