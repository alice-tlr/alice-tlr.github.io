            <h2>What is responsive design?</h2>
            <p>Responsive design have been created to enable websites to be readable and user friendly regardless what what device it is being viewed on. A grid layout allows developers to create website designs by using rows and colounms, which can easily adapt and manipulate depending on what size device the user is using, and depending on the orietation. Most webpage designs follow suit with printed literture, and features are broken down into rows and colunms. This makes it easier for the eyes to break down infomation. and scan quicker. Without responsive design your website users won't get the best from your site. Things will not always be displayed and viewed as the designers intended, which will leave the ender user having a bad experience, and potentially it could stop people engaging as intended.</p>

            <h2>Wireframes</h2>
            <p>Wireframes can be anything from a simple sketch on paper to a cumputer generated design. Wireframing is an illustration of design layout for a webpage, 'boxified' (broken down) into smaller sections. Designers and developers can work together to create the desired page. My wireframes are rough, but communicate what the end result should look like on mobile and desktop. This was my first attempt at mobile first, and it was tricky! I'm not worried that as my coding evolved the design also altured, I realising there was a better way to doing some aspects, and changed my mind. I haven't yet been able to style everything as i'd like, but the structure is in place which is a good start.</p>

              <h2>Mobile first design</h2>
              <p>Mobile first design means exactly what it says, designing an online experience aimed at mobile before designing it for the desktop device. Hisotically, when users' focus was on the desktop, but as time moves on and many more devices are avilable, many more people are using mobile as their first choice for going online. Now mobile design comes first with many designer and developers</p>

          <h2>What is a framework?</h2>
          <p>A framework is a bit like adding on a entire package of coding rules, all within one add on file. This can simplyify coding for developers, and save lots of time. There are tons of different types of frameworks out the for coding for different languages, Tuktuk, Gumby, Bootstrap, Kube, to name but a few.</p>
