           <h2>Time and habits</h2>
           <h3>Which timebox and habits techniques did you try?</h3>

           <p>I have in the past tried viarous types of meditation to try and keep the stress levels of busy life at bay. I have recently been using headspace, and find it does help. I believe it makes me clear my head of trying to think about everything at once, therefore helping me focus on one thing at a time. Definely something i will continue, espeicaly through EDA.</p>

            <h3>What did you find interesting and what worked for you?</h3>

            <p>I found  “The Habits of Successful People: They Have a Growth Mindset” interesting because i feel that a part of me has always thought that way, not outspokenly, but quietly inside my own mind. So reading James Clears article was quite wonderful. I have no more reason than anyone else to be confident, to the outside world on paper and am very average, but i have dogged determination when i want to truely achieve something, whether that be a hobby or education, or socially. When i apporachs new things i just tell meself to go and do what i can do, and my confidence grows as i achieve it. I have always thought the only way to apporach something and learn it well is consistant persitance. I would love to think i had a Growth mindset like the artle discussed - i guess EDA will help me continue to evolve as a person and find out.
            </p>

           <h3>Which will you experiment further with?</h3>

           <p>I have always tried to be organised with study time historically - i generally will break things down into smaller bits and prioritise and work through them strategically. After watching the clip about the Pomodoro technique i will give it a go, as i haven’t previously been specific on alotting time, so i imagine this will help!

           I will also experiment with “foget big change, start with a tiny habit”. I think i can  sometimes be impatient and want to jump in too quick, this approach seems quite sound and reminds me it’s ok to start small.</p>
