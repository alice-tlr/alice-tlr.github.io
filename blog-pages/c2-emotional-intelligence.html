  					<h2>Emotional intelligence</h2>
  					<p>Emotional intelligence is a vast subject matter, an umbrella of soft skills and traits, and like anything will vary in person to person. If we remind ourself that this is a <em>skill</em> then we can aknowledge that emotion intelligence is trainable to <em>anyone</em>. I find the subject of training the amygdala (the part of the brian that controls our emotional response) really interesting. Just like we can train our bodies to preform better, we can do the same with the brains, this can be a life changing skill for any person.</p>

            <p>Headspace is meditation made simple. This site allows you to learn online, when you want, wherever you are, in just 10 minutes a day. It's a fantastic tool, and makes learning mindfullness training easy to fit into your daily life.

            <h2>Mindfulness and it's beneifits</h2>

            <p>Mindfullness is another soft skill that can be developed and trained just like emotional intelligence - one thing helps another, like a journey of self perpetuating awareness. Putting a small amount of time aside each day to help evolve mindfulness skills is time well spent - it allows us to focus on being in the present moment, allow us clarity in our mind. Even starting with just 2 minutes a day is benefical, and i will continue to make time for mindfulness training as i move throught the EDA course.</p>

              <p>Check out more about Googles "Jolly Good Fellow" (real title), Chede-Meng Tan and how he has evolved the teaching of emotional intelligence, to aim to help people find happiness. He teaches that greater complexity outside requires greater clarity inside. Effective leadership isn’t about just checking off more tasks. It’s defined by how well we use our minds and interact with others. We need flexibility and clear purpose in the face of complexity. We need balance, insight, and the ability to inspire others.</p>
