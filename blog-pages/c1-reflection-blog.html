           <h2>Reflection</h2>
           <h3>The bottom of the moutain!</h3>

           <p>My first week with EDA has been exciting and if i’m honest a bit scary. Having wanted to do this now for a few years it feels a little sureal to actually now be starting! No matter how much prep i have tried to do to prepare myself it still feels a little intimidating. I am ignoring the voice that keeps saying “what are you doing?! Why have you done this to yourself?” and swap it for another that just says “you can do this, don’t get flustered, this is so cool and what you’ve been waiting for!” so far it seems to be working.</p>


           <p>Along with starting the course this week it’s come about that in the next month we will probably have to move house!! We are well versed at moving, (Sam is 5 and has lived in 9 houses + emmigrated!) and although it’s stressful and tiring i have it down to a fine art form! I don’t yet know where we will be living which is a little daunting - hopefully by the end of phase 0 that will be all sorted! There is no time to get stressed, so i wont! I am going to do my best to talk to my peers, get to know them all and enjoy meeting other like minded people, it’s an exciting prospect. I used to consider my self a little introvert, but since moving to the other side of the planet and knowing not a soul other than my little family i have really become much more comfortable getting to know new people. Just getting older (35 now) and having kids has made me happier in myself and happier = more confident.</p>

           <p>My first impression of EDA was 2 years ago when i talked with Rohan, and meet Josh at “a day in the life” and i was really inspired by so much of what they talked about. Bridging the gaps in diversity, valuing what different types of people can bring to the table, and the huge importance of communication skills, and emotional intelligence, not to mention making some really cool stuff and helping make a difference!  All of these important values continue to be something that i see and hear, and i feel so happy i will be part of it.  I think it’s the type of culture i will thrive in.</p>
