            <h3>What is the relationship between mindfulness and self awareness?</h3>
            <p>
              Reading a further chapter of <em>"Search inside yourself"</em> this week I have become more aware of some cool stuff, these 2 quote from some of the major contributors of the book sum up the relationship between mindfulness and self awareness....Basically whats being said here is if mindfulness is trainable, then so is self awareness. A combination of these skills can help develope personal and professional sucsess.

                <h3>Self awareness practice</h3>
                <p>
                  Journaling - In essence the practise of journaling to ones self is to discover and become conscious of what our minds are processing. By giving yourself a few minutes a day to write to yourself can help you become aware of thoughts you process without necessarily being aware of it.  Using open ended prompts to start the writing, such as “What I am feeling now is…” is helpful. The point being to let your thoughts flow, and it help your discover why we operate the way we do.

                <h4>What did you take away from the “My Emotions are Not Me” from the book "Search inside yourself"</h4>
                <p>
                  I found the section about Journaling quite interesting - In essence the practise of journaling to ones self is to discover and become conscious of what our minds are processing. By giving yourself a few minutes a day to write to yourself can help you become aware of thoughts you process without necessarily being aware of it.  Using open ended prompts to start the writing, such as “What I am feeling now is…” is helpful. The point being to let your thoughts flow, and it help your discover why we operate the way we do.

                <h4>What did i learn from this?</h4>
                <p>
                  That everything in code is mostly an abbrieviation of other code, and what can look quite intimidating when viewed as one big thing is less scary when you break it down into smaller bits. I apply these principles to many things in life, not just code!.
