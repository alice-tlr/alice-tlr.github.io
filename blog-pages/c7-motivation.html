            <h3>What are my core values?</h3>

            <p>
              Kindness, fairness, working hard, contributing, integrity.<br /><br />

              Being kind, working hard to help myself, my family and a wider group. Wanting to help shape a better funture by contributing something constructive and worthwhile, something thats can help people improve their lives in some way, big or small. These are all thing i hold important.
            </p>

            <h3>What do I stand for?</h3>
            <p>
              Decency. To treat every person with kindness and respect, to value all types of intelligence. To achieve things that make me proud, and to have fun in life.

            </p>

            <h3>How did you find the resilience ideas and meditation exercise?</h3>

            <p>
              It was interesting experiencing the phyical reaction when remmebering expeience of sucess and failiure. The part of the exercise that states “Consider these emotions you are experiencing as simply physiological sensations. That is all. They may be unpleasant, but they are simply experiences. Let’s simply allow these experiences to be present, to come as they wish, and to go as they wish. Just let them be, in a kind, gentle, generous way.” After reading this it helped to diffirenciate between things we do and don’t have control over.<br /><br />
              I think this technique needs to be repeated a few more times to feel like i am absorbing the beneifits, but i feel that is is purposeful and constructive, and will help change the subconscious thought process when faced with similar emotions
